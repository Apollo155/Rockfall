1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:01,433
uh hello

2
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:02,100
so today

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,200
I'll be demonstrating how we began

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,100
building our 3D space shooter game called rockfall

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,166
using unity

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,733
in the space we focused on creating the project

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,900
importing assets building the spaceship

8
00:00:16,33 --> 00:00:18,933
setting up the camera follow system

9
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,733
placing the space station

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,0
adding the skybox

11
00:00:22,0 --> 00:00:26,66
and preparing the UI canvas for future controls

12
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,466
ah so let's begin

13
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,666
first we open uh

14
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:17,733
Unity Hub and create a new project named Rockfall Game

15
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,600
with a 3D template

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,200
when the project loaded

17
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,533
we immediately saved the scene as main

18
00:01:30,33 --> 00:01:32,866
as main as you can see inside the asset folder

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,866
uh next

20
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:39,366
we imported the unity package containing the 3d models

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
textures sounds

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
and other resources needed for the game

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
so after importing the assets

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,66
we started building our first game object

25
00:01:52,66 --> 00:01:53,400
named the spaceship

26
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:03,300
or sheep

27
00:02:05,0 --> 00:02:09,500
we went uh we renamed it renamed it as sheep

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,300
then from the models folder we drag

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,266
the ship model under the ship object

30
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,866
which made it a child

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,900
we renamed this child

32
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,66
object graphics

33
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,266
we reset the graphics object position

34
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:30,66
so it aligned perfectly with the invisible

35
00:02:30,66 --> 00:02:31,533
parent ship object

36
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:47,66
uh next we wanted the camera to follow

37
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,366
to follow the ship smoothly

38
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,866
rather than being parented directly to it

39
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,566
we added a new script to the main camera called Smooth

40
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:58,766
Follow that CS

41
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,333
this script calculates a position behind

42
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,166
behind and above the spaceship

43
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:04,500
then

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,400
smoothly interpolates the camera toward that position

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,300
every frame

46
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:13,300
we assigned the ship object to

47
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,866
the scripts

48
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,733
target field and adjusted values like height

49
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,500
distance and damping

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,166
when we tested the game the camera

51
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:28,400
followed the ship smoothly with a natural delay

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,566
making the gameplay

53
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:33,100
gameplay feel more dynamic and realistic

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,400
next we place the space station

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,266
with which the player will protect later in the game

56
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,266
we created another empty game object

57
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,366
named Space Station

58
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:14,0
we reset the model's position so it aligned properly

59
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,500
we checked the station model

60
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,933
and confirmed that it already contained mesh colliders

61
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,266
uh which were automatically

62
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:24,466
generated when importing the asset

63
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,266
so to make the game feel like outer space

64
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:34,566
we replace Unity's default Skybox with our space Skybox

65
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,66
we created a new material name Skybox

66
00:04:38,66 --> 00:04:41,766
and change it shader to Skybox 6 sided

67
00:04:46,0 --> 00:04:47,966
then we assign the six texture

68
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,366
ah images to their correct sides front back

69
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,200
left right and up and down

70
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,766
finally we open up the lighting settings

71
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:59,66
and assign this Skybox material

72
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,166
the environment instantly looked like deep space

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,400
and the objects even received a green tint

74
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,866
based on their reflections on the sky

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,100
so for the last step in this space uh

76
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,0
space was setting up the UI canvas for controls

77
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,800
ah we created a canvas

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,666
which automatically generated an event system

79
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,200
we changed the canvas render mode to screen

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,766
space camera

81
00:05:37,33 --> 00:05:37,166
uh

82
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,866
assign the main camera and set the plane distance to 1

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,0
we also change uh UA scale mode mode

84
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,466
to scale with screen size

85
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:53,33
and set the reference resolution to

86
00:05:53,33 --> 00:05:55,900
1280 X 7 20

87
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,600
which is ideal for mobile controls

88
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,866
this canvas will later hold on

89
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,600
hold the on screen joystick

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,533
and fire button for controlling the ship

91
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:10,800
and that completes the first development stage

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,766
for a space shooter game Rockford

93
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,966
now I'll be demonstrating on how

94
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,766
it works in mobile app

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,733
so start we start a new game

96
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,666
these are the controls

97
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,966
a pause button

98
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:34,666
and

99
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,966
so for the

100
00:06:41,66 --> 00:06:43,100
space station it's right there

101
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,66
and the asteroids are going straight at it

102
00:06:48,66 --> 00:06:49,600
so you can shoot at it

103
00:06:56,66 --> 00:06:59,0
so that's it for the rockfall game
