# **Rockfall 3D – Spaceship Survival Game**

Rockfall 3D is a fast-paced **3D spaceship survival and shooting game** where players dodge falling asteroids while navigating through space. Your mission is simple:
**Avoid incoming rocks, survive as long as possible, and destroy asteroids using your blaster.**

Built using **Unity 6000.2.6f2**, this game serves as a prototype and learning project demonstrating movement, physics, and shooting mechanics.

## **Game Overview**

Pilot a spaceship through an asteroid-filled zone where rocks constantly fall from above.
